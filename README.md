This project is just an example on how to consume RESTful APIs using Django.

It uses the following:

* IP address lookup:
By using http://freegeoip.net/json/, the app returns your current public IP address as well as your approximate location in a google maps iframe.

* GitHub repos lookup:
By using the GitHub API, the app searches github by username and returns the user's name and number of public repos.

* Oxford dictionary lookup:
By using the Oxford dictionary API, the app returns definitions of a queried word.

This project is deployed at [restful-apis.herokuapp.com](https://restful-apis.herokuapp.com/).
